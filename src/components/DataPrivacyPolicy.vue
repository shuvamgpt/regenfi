                <strong>SECURITY</strong>
                <p>
                  All User passwords are encrypted. When You create an account
                  or update Your password, the password is immediately encrypted
                  before being stored in Our database. Encryption is a process
                  that converts plain-text data (the user's password) into an
                  unreadable format using a cryptographic key. This ensures that
                  even if unauthorized individuals gain access to the database,
                  they will not be able to decipher the passwords without the
                  corresponding decryption key.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We also implement measures to protect the encryption keys,
                  limiting access to authorized personnel only. This adds an
                  extra layer of security to prevent potential data breaches. By
                  employing encryption techniques, we prioritize the
                  confidentiality and integrity of Your passwords, making it
                  significantly more challenging for malicious actors to exploit
                  any potential security vulnerabilities and compromise the
                  security of Your account. Our commitment to data security is
                  steadfast, and We continuously review and improve Our
                  practices to stay up-to-date with the latest security
                  standards.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We also use the following security measures to protect Your

                  vulnerabilities and ensures that potential security flaws are
                  identified and addressed early on;
                </p>
                <p>
                  c) Access Control and Authorization: Implement proper access
                  controls, ensuring that Users can only access the data and
                  features that are relevant to their roles;
                </p>
                <p>
                  d) Data Minimization: Collect and store only the data that is
                  necessary for the Services and the functionality of the
                  Platform, minimizing the potential impact of a data breach;
                </p>

                  known vulnerabilities;
                </p>
                <p>
                  f) Regular Backups: Regularly backing up data to prevent data
                  loss in case of system failures or ransomware attacks;
                </p>
                <p>
                  g) Privacy Policy and User Consent: This Privacy Policy
                  outlines the data collected, its usage, and Users' rights.
                  Obtain explicit User consent for data collection and
                  processing; and
                </p>
                <p>
                  h) Monitoring and Logging: Implement monitoring and logging
                  mechanisms to detect and respond to security incidents
                  promptly.
